# Cross-Modal-Remote-Sensing-Image-Sound-Retrieval

This repository is for the research of cross-modal remote sensing image-sound retrieval.

We develop three 

\subsubsection{\textbf{Sydney Image-Voice Dataset \cite{8486338}}} The Sydney image-voice (Sydney IV) dataset contains 613 RS images and 3065 voices of 7 classes, where each image corresponds to five different voices. In this paper, we follow the previous works \cite{8896932, chen2019a, 9044618}, and randomly sample a voice from the five voices for each image to construct RS image-voice pairs. As for the data partitioning, 80\% RS image-voice pairs are randomly selected for training, and the rest 20\% are selected for testing.

\subsubsection{\textbf{UCM Image-Voice Dataset \cite{8486338}}} The UCM image-voice (UCM IV) dataset includes 2100 RS images and 10500 voices, where each image corresponds to five different voices. Note that the dataset can be divided into 21 classes, where each class includes 100 images and 500 voices. In this paper, we follow the previous works \cite{8896932, chen2019a, 9044618}, and randomly sample a voice from the five voices for each image to construct RS image-voice pairs. As for the data partitioning, 80\% RS image-voice pairs are randomly selected as training set, and the rest 20\% are selected as testing set.

\subsubsection{\textbf{RSICD Image-Voice Dataset \cite{8486338}}} The RSICD image-voice (RSICD IV) dataset involves 10921 RS images and 54605 voices of 30 classes, where each image corresponds to five different voices. In this paper, we follow the previous works \cite{8896932, chen2019a, 9044618}, and randomly sample a voice from the five voices for each image to construct RS image-voice pairs. As for the data partitioning, 80\% RS image-voice pairs are randomly selected for training, and the rest 20\% are selected for testing.
